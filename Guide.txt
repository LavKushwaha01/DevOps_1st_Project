(1.)=> coding part

-----------------------------

(2.)=> image creation and run on container 

1st for build image of backend run the cmd 
  | ~/Desktop/DEVOPS/Projects/1st_node_project$  sudo docker build -f Dockerfile/Dockerfile.backend -t my-node-app .

2nd for build image of frontend run the cmd
  | lav@lav-Aspire-A715-51G:~/Desktop/DEVOPS/Projects/1st_node_project$ sudo docker build -f Dockerfile/Dockerfile.frontend -t my-react-app ./Frontend

3rd for run backend use cmd
  | docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app

4th for run frontend use cmd 
  | docker run -p 5173:5173 my-react-app

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Now our both frontend and image is created and run on live server at localHost://5173 and 3000 port respectively and all the data 
  from frontend we give store to our database at Docker-database

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

create a dir .github/workflows and inside these create files of yml for both frontend and backend 
then just push it on github and these yml run all the cmds and deploy our appplication to live server 

 *** create gcp as usualy but after create go to edit section and then in ssh add type1 and add public key which private key we kept locally
then go tp vps network -> firewall -> create firewall rule : add your TCP port here and 0.0.0.0/0 for all machine and some other cheaks

after all of these when code is pushed in VM

/ for ssh use ssh lav@Ipv4 and then 1st install docker in cmd shell it will not installed by github action

set enviorement variable by referance of yml file and set fetch request to external Ip now not in localhost 

**** if faces any issue just read all codes of this file
